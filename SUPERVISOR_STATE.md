# SUPERVISOR_STATE.md — OPERATION GLASS PIPES

> **Terminology reminder**: A *mission* is the definable scope of work. A *sortie* is an atomic agent task within that mission.

## Mission Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Operation name | OPERATION GLASS PIPES |
| Mission | swift-tuberia-instrumentation |
| Iteration | 1 |
| Starting point commit | `b6f3ba6414061d413b29b27cf6711605afebcef5` |
| Starting branch | `development` |
| Mission branch | `instrumentation/01` |
| Source requirements | `REQUIREMENTS-instrumentation.md` |
| Parent plan | `../Vinetas/EXECUTION_PLAN.md` (cross-repo Vinetas campaign) |
| Critical path | true (upstream of flux-2-swift-mlx, pixart-swift-mlx, SwiftVinetas) |

| Mission started | 2026-05-12 |

## Plan Summary

- Work units: 1
- Total sorties: 7
- Dependency structure: sequential (single linear critical path)
- Dispatch mode: dynamic prompt construction (no explicit template in plan)
- Max intra-plan parallelism: 1
- Max retries per sortie: 3
- Default max_turns per dispatch: 50

| Name | Directory | Sorties | Dependencies |

### swift-tuberia-instrumentation

- Work unit state: RUNNING
- Current sortie: 2 of 7
- Sortie state: DISPATCHED
- Sortie type: code
- Model: opus
- Complexity score: 13 (turns 3 + files 2 + foundation 5 + dep-depth 2 + risk 1; force-opus override: foundation=1 ∧ dep-depth=5)
- Attempt: 1 of 3
- Last verified: Sortie 1 commit 9ccee09 verified — 4 files present, public ABI confirmed by grep, no fatalError, threshold knob present, make build/test/lint all green per agent + spot-check
- Notes: Mechanical defaulted-param plumbing across 4 files + 1 new extension file. Plan rates complexity 1, but force-opus fires because this sets the pattern Sorties 3-7 all consume.

## Sortie History

| Sortie | State | Attempt | Model | Commit | Verified |
|--------|-------|---------|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | COMPLETED | 1/3 | opus | 9ccee09 | Files present, public ABI green, build/test/lint clean. 2 surfacings (nonisolated(unsafe) var; pre-reduction f32 cast) — both accepted, see Decisions Log. |

## Decisions Log

| Timestamp | Work Unit | Sortie | Decision | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|--------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-05-12 | — | — | Base branch: development @ b6f3ba6 | Plan says "default branch HEAD" but REQUIREMENTS-instrumentation.md and untracked EXECUTION_PLAN.md only exist on development. User confirmed dev as base. |
| 2026-05-12 | — | — | Mission branch: `instrumentation/01` (plan-specified, not skill default `mission/glass-pipes/01`) | Plan is part of cross-repo Vinetas campaign that expects this branch convention. Plan content wins over supervisor convention defaults; skill.md precedence applies only to dispatch/state/error-handling. |
| 2026-05-12 | — | — | Autonomy: full autonomous chain | User-confirmed. Supervisor dispatches each next sortie as soon as prior verifies COMPLETED; only stops on BLOCKED/FATAL or user `stop`. |
| 2026-05-12 | — | — | Operation name: OPERATION GLASS PIPES | THE RITUAL — generated via haiku. Plumbing pun lands (Tuberia=plumbing); evokes transparency/observability of opaque pipeline internals. |
| 2026-05-12 | swift-tuberia-instrumentation | 1 | Model: opus | Complexity score 20. Force-opus override fires (foundation=1 ∧ dep-depth=5). Cross-repo public API — getting the surface wrong cascades to flux/pixart/SwiftVinetas. |
| 2026-05-12 | swift-tuberia-instrumentation | 1 | Sortie 1 COMPLETED — accept `nonisolated(unsafe) static var` for defaultOutOfRangeThreshold | Plan Q2 required a `var` for runtime override. Swift 6 strict concurrency forbids plain mutable globals; alternatives (`let`, actor wrap) break the override intent or call-site simplicity. Pragmatic accept; document in PR description. |
| 2026-05-12 | swift-tuberia-instrumentation | 1 | Sortie 1 COMPLETED — accept pre-reduction `.float32` cast in `sample()` | Defensive against fp16/bfloat16 overflow (mirrors T5RMSNorm precedent in AGENTS.md v0.6.1). Cost is one extra MLX op per sample() call, but sample() is never called when telemetry is nil — doesn't affect the +1% overhead bar measured in Sortie 7. |
| 2026-05-12 | swift-tuberia-instrumentation | 2 | Model: opus | Complexity score 13. Plan rates work as "complexity 1, risk 1" (mechanical defaulted-param plumbing) but force-opus override fires (foundation=1 ∧ dep-depth=5). Cost is intentional: getting a parameter type wrong here breaks every emission sortie. |

## Overall Status

**State**: RUNNING — Sortie 1 COMPLETED ✓. Sortie 2 (opus, async) dispatching.

**Next action**: When Sortie 2 completes, run verification cascade and transition. On COMPLETED, dispatch Sortie 3.
